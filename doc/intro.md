__Galilei__ is a simple library for performing disk I/O with Scala. It provides access to most filesystem
operations through the `Path` type—an abstract representation of a file or a directory—plus typeclass-based
`read` and `write` methods which can use ad-hoc types, including streaming types like `LazyList`. Galilei is
designed to take advantage of Scala 3's safer exceptions.
